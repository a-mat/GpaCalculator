grades all seperated by one space. The int value proceeding each assigment type, is the 
assignment weight. Following the assignment weight, there can be any number of assignment grades enterd.
The following line represents an example



3 Biology Test 30 90 80 Quiz 20 50 80 90 Homework 50 5 10 20 30 40 50
3 Calc Test 50 100 80 Quiz 20 88 50 30 50 Homework 30 5 10 20 30


In this input, each line represents an individual course. THe first int represents the credits
that the class is worth. Right after the credits the name of the class is shown.
For the first line, Biology is the course. Right after the name of the course, an
assignment type( "Test" in this case) followed by the weight of the assignment(30%).
Then the grades for the test are listed( 90 and 80). Then the next Assignment is typed
